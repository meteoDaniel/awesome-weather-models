## Why this Page?
This page provide a catalogue and categorization of AI-based weather forecasting models. The aim is that this page will enable discovery and comparison of the different available model options. 

## How to Contribute? 
Contributions are much welcome! 

1) Add a model to the list
2) Update categorization and links

Feel free to make a PR and we will incorporate it. 

## Weather Model Categorization
The weather models are categorized according to the JSON schema specified in ["schema_ai_models.json"](https://github.com/rebase-energy/awesome-weather-models/blob/main/schema_ai_models.json).

## Weather Models
In alphabetical order.
