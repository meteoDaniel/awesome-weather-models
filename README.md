    <strong>A catalogue and categorization of AI-based weather forecasting models. 
   </strong>
</p>

## Why this Page?
This page provide a catalogue and categorization of AI-based weather forecasting models. The aim is that this page will enable discovery and comparison of the different available model options. 

## Weather Models
The weather models are categorized according meta data found in the JSON schema specification ([schema_ai_models.json](https://github.com/rebase-energy/awesome-weather-models/blob/main/schema_ai_models.json)). Below is a table in alphabetical order extracted from the full categorization providing name, description and if it is an open model. 

* **Operational Data**: Forecast data from the model is provided at an operational basis.
* **Open Source**: The source code is provided as open source. 
* **Open Weights**: The model weights are provided as open weights.
