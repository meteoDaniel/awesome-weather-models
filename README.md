## Why this Page?
This page provide a catalogue and categorization of physics- and AI-based weather forecasting models. The aim is that this page will enable discovery and comparison of the different available model options. 

## How to Contribute? 
1) Add a model to the list
2) Update categorization and links

## Weather Model Categorization
The weather models are categorized according to several characteristics. 


| Characteristics   | Fields        |
| :---              | :---          |
| **Resolution**     | Resolution in space |
| **Grid Type**  |  |
